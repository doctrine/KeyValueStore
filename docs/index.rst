Welcome to Doctrine KeyValueStore's documentation!
==================================================

The Doctrine KeyValueStore project allows you to map PHP Objects
to a large number of key-value databases. To some degree these
databases are exchangeable, when working on a CRUD level.

For some databases range queries are also supported that allow
you to do range queries with parititioning.
